      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        BuurtBox was a project within the Experience Architect postgraduate
        education at Artevelde Hogeschool in Gent, Belgium. Over the course of a
        year, the goal was to apply different aspects of Service Design and UX
        Design to a case.

      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        BuurtBox started in a very wide problem space: sustainability. To come
        to a well-defined challenge statement desk research was carried out to
        explore the problem space and find opportunities for innovative
        solutions. One of opportunities spaces is our food consumption. This led
        me to following challenge statement:

        <p class="font-body pt-4">
          To encourage consumers to adopt a more sustainable shopping habit, any
          potential solution must also offer considerable benefits with regards
          to convience or price compared to the current way consumers do their
          grocery shopping. The amout of effort consumer put in preparing their
          grocery shopping could provide such an opportunity for improvement.
