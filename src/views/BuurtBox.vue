      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        BuurtBox was a project within the Experience Architect postgraduate
        education at Artevelde Hogeschool in Gent, Belgium. Over the course of a
        year, the goal was to apply different aspects of Service Design and UX
        Design to a case.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        BuurtBox started in a very wide problem space: sustainability. To come
        to a well-defined challenge statement desk research was carried out to
        explore the problem space and find opportunities for innovative
        solutions. One of opportunities spaces is our food consumption. This led
        me to following challenge statement:

        To get more insight into the problem space, qaulitative research was
        done. More in partiucular, I conducted in-depth interviews with 6 end
        users. The results from these interviews were aggregated into three
        different personas. In addition to this research, I orgnaised a
        co-creative workshop to build out the customer journey of going grocery
        shopping.

          To encourage consumers to adopt a more sustainable shopping habit, any
          potential solution must also offer considerable benefits with regards
          to convience or price compared to the current way consumers do their
          grocery shopping. The amout of effort consumer put in preparing their
          grocery shopping could provide such an opportunity for improvement.

      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        Starting off with multiple ideation sessions, one of them a
        collaborative workshop with 4 end users, I ended up with more than a 100
        different ideas on how to encourage a more sustainable shopping habit.
        The three ideas with the most potential were evaluated using a value
        proposition canvas. One of them provided the best answer to the double
        problem stated above: BuurtBox.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body pt-4">
        To evaluate the viability of this idea, multiple hypotheses were formed,
        each of them evaluated by building a corresponding prototype.

          Using the different protoypes, I was able to confirm most of the
          hypotheses. One of the biggest oversights however was the lack of
          involvement of shopkeepers up until this point. I tried to correct
          this by gauging shopkeeper intereset using a fake landing page, but it
          proved a lot harder than expected to generate traffic to this site.

        <p class="pt-4">
          As mentioned above, BuurtBox was created within the context of a
          Postgraduate education. As such, it was in no way the goal of this
          project to end up with a finished product. Rather, the main goal of this
          project was to have a taste of the different steps involved in
          creating a new digital product.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          There is still a lot of work to be done to validate BuurtBox as a
          product, most of which relating to the shopkeeper-side of the product.
          I would need to take a step back to user research to interview some
          shopkeepers, get a grip on their customer journey and validate whether
          my assumption that local shop owners would like to increase their
          online presence is correct.
