        "Now the corona pandemic is slowly subsiding (at least in Belgium, knock on wood ðŸ¤ž) weâ€™re moving into a more hybrid way of working. Research suggest working from home makes it harder for people to make a clear distinction between their work an private life, potentially having a negative effect on their work balance. Itâ€™s even shown that working from home can increase burnouts. Chillz aims to encourage workers to take some time off during the day by encouraging planning of personal time and providing incentives to take up this personal time."
